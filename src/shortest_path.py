CLASS METHOD / STATIC METHOD

class method vs static method in Python
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/class-method-vs-static-method-python/
https://www.tutorialspoint.com/class-method-vs-static-method-in-python

CLASS
- A class method receives the class as implicit first argument, just like an instance method receives the instance.
- A class method is a method which is bound to the class and not the object of the class.
They have the access to the state of the class as it takes a class parameter that points to the class and not the object instance.   
- It can modify a class state that would apply across all the instances of the class. For example it can modify a class variable that will be applicable to all the instances. 

STATIC
- bound to class, not class instance
- does not receive an implicit first argument
- A static method canâ€™t access or modify class state.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/136097/difference-between-staticmethod-and-classmethod
CLASS
intend to call it from the class rather than from a class instance

STATIC
behave like plain functions except that you can call them from an instance or the class
used to group functions

MY NOTES

variables in open() block seem to be global, not local

visited-locations = sequence of packages to deliver
locations-to-visit = delivered packages
This may seem counter intuitive, but it's from the perspective of the algorithm, not from the 
perspective of the truck.
